## Overview

Rate Reports help you create professional, shareable income summaries for specific clients, trips, or time periods. These reports are essential for:

- **Client billing** - Share trip details with clients for invoice generation
- **Internal accounting** - Provide finance teams with structured income data
- **Client communications** - Professional documentation of services rendered
- **Record keeping** - Maintain organized trip history by client

## When to Generate a Rate Report

Generate a Rate Report when you need to:

✅ Bill a client for trips completed during a specific period  
✅ Provide trip documentation to your finance/accounting team  
✅ Share service delivery confirmation with clients  
✅ Create backup records of income for specific routes or vehicles

<Info>
  **Future Feature:** Travada will soon include automatic invoice generation. For now, use Rate Reports to provide your finance team with the data needed to create invoices manually.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Name reports clearly with the client name and period:
    - ✅ Good: "Artcaffe February 2026", "Unilever Q1 Rate Report"
    - ❌ Poor: "Report 1", "Client Report", "Feb"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Verify Data Before Generating" icon="clipboard-check">
    Double-check your filtered data before clicking Generate Report. Once generated, you can't edit the report—you'll need to delete and recreate it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Appropriate Expiry Dates" icon="calendar-days">
    - For monthly client reports: 60-90 days
    - For quarterly summaries: 120 days
    - For annual records: 365+ days
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clean Up Old Reports" icon="trash-can">
    Periodically delete expired or obsolete reports to keep your Reports page organized.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Confirm VAT Requirements" icon="percent">
    Check with your client or accounting team whether VAT should be included before generating the report.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monthly Client Billing" icon="calendar-days">
    **Scenario:** You need to bill Artcaffe for all trips in February
    
    **Steps:**
    1. Filter dates: 01 Feb 2026 - 28 Feb 2026
    2. Filter destination: "ARTCAFFE KISUMU" (if applicable)
    3. Verify total rate fee matches expected amount
    4. Generate report with client name "Artcaffe"
    5. Include VAT if required
    6. Share link with finance team or client
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Container Trip Summary" icon="box">
    **Scenario:** Client needs documentation of container trips
    
    **Steps:**
    1. Filter by date range for the trips
    2. Filter by vehicle if only specific trucks were used
    3. Fill in Container No, Weight, Size, and Pickup Location
    4. Generate report with all container details
    5. Share with client for their customs/clearance needs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multi-Destination Report" icon="route">
    **Scenario:** Client has trips to multiple destinations
    
    **Option A (Combined):**
    - Filter by client's destinations only
    - Generate one report with all trips
    
    **Option B (Separate):**
    - Generate individual reports per destination
    - Name clearly: "Client - Destination - Period"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Report shows wrong total amount" icon="calculator">
    **Cause:** Filters may not be capturing all intended trips
    
    **Solution:**
    - Clear all filters and manually verify which trips should be included
    - Check date ranges carefully (ensure you're using the correct month/year)
    - Verify the "Total Rate Fee" at top right matches your expectation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't include both rate and detention in one report" icon="money-bill-wave">
    **Current Limitation:** Rate Reports show only Rate Fees. Detention fees are tracked separately.
    
    **Workaround:**
    - Generate a Rate Report for rate fees
    - Generate a separate Detention Report (if feature is available)
    - Manually combine totals if needed for client invoicing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Report link not working" icon="link-slash">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Report has expired
    - Report was deleted
    
    **Solution:**
    - Check the expiry date in the Reports table
    - Generate a new report if needed
    - Extend expiry dates for important reports in the future
