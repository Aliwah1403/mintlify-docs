## Overview

Travada helps you track fuel discounts received from partner petrol stations. This feature allows you to:

- Record discounts for individual trips
- Apply the same discount to multiple trips at once (bulk discount)
- Calculate total fuel savings
- See fuel cost vs. discounted cost comparisons

## Why Track Fuel Discounts?

Fuel is typically one of the largest expenses in logistics operations. By tracking discounts:

✅ You know exactly how much money you're saving from fuel partnerships\
✅ You can see which vehicles benefit most from discounted fuel\
✅ Your expense reports show true out-of-pocket costs\
✅ You can negotiate better rates with fuel stations by showing usage volume

## Understanding Fuel Discount Calculation

When you add a fuel discount, Travada calculates:

```
Liters Filled = Fuel Cost ÷ Standard Price per Liter
Total Discount = (Standard Price - Discounted Price) × Liters Filled
```

**Example:**

- Standard fuel price: KES 150 per liter
- You paid: KES 12,000 for fuel
- Liters filled: 12,000 ÷ 150 = 80 liters
- Discounted price: KES 145 per liter
- Discount saved: (150 - 145) × 80 = **KES 400**

## Individual Fuel Discount

Use this method when applying a discount to a **single vehicle's trip**.

### When to Use Individual Discounts

- Only one vehicle fueled at a partner station
- Different vehicles got different discount rates
- You're correcting or updating a specific trip's discount

### How to Apply Individual Discount

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Fuel Costs">
    Click **Expenses** in the sidebar, then select the **Fuel** tab

    ![Fuel Tab Navigation](/images/fuel-tab.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the Trip">
    Find the trip you want to add a discount to in the fuel expenses table
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Actions Menu">
    Click the **⋮** (three dots) button on the right side of the row

    Select **Add Discount** from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Discount Details">
    In the "Add Fuel Discount" dialog, fill in:

    - **Standard Fuel Price (KES per litre)**: Enter the regular price (e.g., 150)
    - **Discounted Fuel Price (KES per litre)**: Enter the discounted rate (e.g., 145)
    - **Litres (Fuel filled)**: This is auto-calculated based on your fuel cost

    ![Fuel Discount Dialog](/Screenshot2026-01-30at9.33.07am-1.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Discount">
    Click **Calculate Discount** to calculate the discount based on the Fuel Prices you entered above.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Fuel Discount">
    Click **Save Discount**

    The discount will now appear in the "Fuel Discount" column for that trip
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The **Litres (Fuel filled)** field auto-calculates when you enter the Standard Fuel Price. This ensures accuracy based on the actual fuel cost already recorded.
</Tip>

## Bulk Fuel Discount

Use this method when applying the **same discount to multiple vehicles** that fueled at the same station.

### When to Use Bulk Discounts

- Multiple vehicles fueled at the same partner station
- All vehicles got the same discount rate
- You want to save time instead of adding discounts one-by-one

### How to Apply Bulk Discount

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Fuel Costs">
    Go to **Expenses** → **Fuel** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Multiple Trips">
    Check the boxes next to all trips you want to apply the discount to

    ![Bulk Select Fuel Trips](/Screenshot2026-01-30at9.33.15am.png)

    A selection toolbar will appear at the bottom showing how many trips are selected
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Discount">
    In the selection toolbar, click the **Add discount** button

    ![Bulk Discount Toolbar](/Screenshot2026-01-30at9.33.20am.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Discount Details">
    In the "Add Fuel Discount to X expenses" dialog:

    - **Standard Fuel Price (KES per litre)**: Enter the regular price
    - **Discounted Fuel Price (KES per litre)**: Enter the discounted rate
    - **Litres (Fuel filled)**: Shows total litres across all selected trips

    The **Total Fuel Cost (Selected)** and **Total Calculated Discount** will display
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Discount">
    Click **Calculate Discount** to apply the same per-litre discount to all selected trips

    All selected trips will now show the fuel discount in their respective rows
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Time Saver:** If 10 vehicles all fueled at the same Shell station with a KES 5 per liter discount, you can apply the discount to all 10 trips in one go instead of 10 separate actions.
</Check>

## Removing Fuel Discounts

If you need to remove a discount (e.g., it was applied incorrectly):

### Remove Individual Discount

1. Navigate to **Expenses** → **Fuel**
2. Find the trip with the discount
3. Click **⋮** (three dots) and select **Remove Discount**
4. Confirm the removal

### Remove Bulk Discounts

1. Select multiple trips with discounts (using checkboxes)
2. Click **Remove discount** in the selection toolbar
3. Click the **X** button to confirm removal for all selected trips

![Remove Bulk Discount](/images/remove-bulk-discount.png)

<Warning>
  Removing a discount is permanent and cannot be undone. You'll need to re-enter the discount details if you remove it by mistake.
</Warning>

## Viewing Total Fuel Savings

To see your total fuel discount savings:

1. Navigate to **Expenses** → **Fuel**
2. Look at the top right summary card

![Fuel Cost Summary](/images/fuel-summary.png)

You'll see:

- **Fuel Cost**: Total amount spent on fuel (before discounts)
- **Fuel Discount**: Total savings from all discounts applied

<Note>
  **Example:** If your Fuel Cost is KES 205,604 and your Fuel Discount is KES 3,500, your actual out-of-pocket fuel expense is KES 202,104.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Apply Discounts Regularly" icon="calendar-check">
    Set a schedule to apply discounts (e.g., weekly) rather than letting them pile up. This keeps your expense data accurate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify Partner Station Rates" icon="clipboard-check">
    Confirm the discount rate with your fuel station partner before applying to ensure accuracy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Bulk for Consistency" icon="layer-group">
    When multiple vehicles fuel at the same station on the same day, use bulk discount to ensure consistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Station Partnerships" icon="handshake">
    Keep a record outside Travada of which stations offer discounts and at what rates for quick reference.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Mistake 1:** Entering the discounted price in the "Fuel Cost" field when recording the trip

  **Solution:** Always enter the **actual amount paid** in Fuel Cost, then apply the discount separately to show the savings.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Mistake 2:** Applying discounts with incorrect standard price

  **Solution:** Double-check the current market fuel price before applying discounts to ensure accurate calculations.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Mistake 3:** Forgetting to apply discounts consistently

  **Solution:** Create a checklist or reminder to review and apply fuel discounts at the end of each week.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discount calculation seems wrong" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Check:**

    - Is the Standard Fuel Price correct for that date?
    - Did you enter the Discounted Price correctly?
    - Is the original Fuel Cost in the trip accurate?

    **Solution:** Remove the discount and reapply with verified numbers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't select multiple trips for bulk discount" icon="square-check">
    **Check:**

    - Are all trips showing fuel costs (not KES 0)?
    - Do you have Admin permissions?

    **Solution:** Only trips with fuel costs can have discounts applied. Verify you're selecting the correct rows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Discount not showing in reports" icon="file-invoice">
    **Issue:** Fuel discounts are tracked separately from expenses

    **Solution:** View the Fuel tab specifically, or check if your report type includes discount details. Future report versions may include discount breakdowns.
