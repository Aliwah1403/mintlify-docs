## Overview

The Financial Summary section at the top of your dashboard provides the three most critical metrics for understanding your business health. These numbers tell you at a glance whether you're making money, how much you're spending, and your overall profitability.

## The Three Key Metrics

### 1. Total Income

**What it measures:** All revenue earned from completed trips

**Calculation:**

```
Total Income = Sum of all Rate Fees + Sum of all Detention Fees
```

**Example:**

- Trip 1: Rate KES 15,000 + Detention KES 0 = KES 15,000
- Trip 2: Rate KES 98,400 + Detention KES 0 = KES 98,400
- Trip 3: Rate KES 125,000 + Detention KES 5,000 = KES 130,000
- **Total Income = KES 243,400**

<Info>
  Income includes both Rate fees (base transport charges) and Detention fees
  (container delay charges). Most trips only have Rate fees.
</Info>

**What the percentage means:**

The percentage shows growth or decline compared to the **previous period** of the same length.

**Example:**

- Current period (Last 30 days): KES 243,400
- Previous period (30 days before that): KES 200,000
- Growth: +21.7% ↑

<Tip>
  A green upward arrow (↑) indicates growth, while a red downward arrow (↓)
  indicates decline.
</Tip>

### 2. Total Expense

**What it measures:** All costs incurred during trips

**Calculation:**

```
Total Expense = Fuel + Clerk Fee + Mileage Fee + Parking + Repair + Extra Costs
```

**Example:**

- Fuel: KES 150,000
- Clerk Fees: KES 10,000
- Mileage: KES 15,000
- Parking: KES 2,000
- Repairs: KES 45,000
- Extra: KES 3,000
- **Total Expense = KES 225,000**

<Warning>
  If Total Expense shows "N/A", it means no expense data has been recorded. Make
  sure you're filling in expense fields when recording trips.
</Warning>

**Expense percentage:**

Shows how your spending has changed compared to the previous period.

**Example:**

- Current period: KES 225,000
- Previous period: KES 180,000
- Increase: +25% ↑

<Note>
  An increase in expenses isn't always bad - it might correlate with increased
  trip volume. The key is comparing it to your income growth.
</Note>

### 3. Total Revenue

**What it measures:** Your net profit (or loss) after expenses

**Calculation:**

```
Total Revenue = Total Income - Total Expense
```

**Example:**

- Total Income: KES 243,400
- Total Expense: KES 225,000
- **Total Revenue = KES 18,400**

This is your **actual profit** for the period.

**Understanding the percentage:**

Shows profit growth or decline vs. previous period.

**Example scenarios:**

**Scenario 1 - Healthy Growth:**

- Revenue: KES 50,000
- Change: +30% ↑ (green)
- **Meaning:** Your profitability is improving

**Scenario 2 - Declining Profit:**

- Revenue: KES 20,000
- Change: -15% ↓ (red)
- **Meaning:** Profit margins are shrinking

**Scenario 3 - Loss:**

- Revenue: -KES 10,000 (negative)
- **Meaning:** Expenses exceeded income this period

<Warning>
  Negative revenue means you're operating at a loss. Review your expense
  breakdown and vehicle performance to identify issues.
</Warning>

## Reading the Metrics Together

The three metrics work together to tell your business story:

### Healthy Business Pattern

| Metric        | Value       | Change |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Total Income  | KES 500,000 | ↑ 20%  |
| Total Expense | KES 350,000 | ↑ 15%  |
| Total Revenue | KES 150,000 | ↑ 30%  |

**Analysis:** Income growing faster than expenses = increasing profitability ✅

### Warning Pattern

| Metric        | Value       | Change |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Total Income  | KES 400,000 | ↑ 10%  |
| Total Expense | KES 380,000 | ↑ 25%  |
| Total Revenue | KES 20,000  | ↓ 60%  |

**Analysis:** Expenses growing faster than income = shrinking margins ⚠️

### Crisis Pattern

| Metric        | Value       | Change |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Total Income  | KES 300,000 | ↓ 15%  |
| Total Expense | KES 350,000 | ↑ 10%  |
| Total Revenue | -KES 50,000 | ↓ 200% |

**Analysis:** Declining income + rising expenses = operating loss 🚨

## Period Comparison

The comparison percentages are calculated based on your **date filter selection**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="7D (7 Days)">
    **Current:** Last 7 days **Previous:** 7 days before that **Example:** -
    Current: Feb 3-9 - Previous: Jan 27 - Feb 2
  </Tab>

<Tab title="1M (1 Month)">
  **Current:** Last 30 days **Previous:** 30 days before that **Example:** -
  Current: Jan 10 - Feb 9 - Previous: Dec 11 - Jan 9
</Tab>

<Tab title="3M (3 Months)">
  **Current:** Last 90 days **Previous:** 90 days before that **Example:** -
  Current: Nov 11 - Feb 9 - Previous: Aug 13 - Nov 10
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Range">
    **Current:** Your selected range **Previous:** Same number of days before
    **Example:** - Current: Jan 1-31 (31 days) - Previous: Dec 1-31 (31 days)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  The system automatically calculates the comparison period - you don't need to
  select it manually.
</Info>

## When Numbers Don't Make Sense

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Income and Revenue are the same" icon="equals">
    **Cause:** You have no recorded expenses **Check:** - Are you recording
    trips with expense fields filled in? - Is Total Expense showing "N/A"?
    **Solution:** Ensure you're entering expense data when recording trips
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Massive percentage changes (500%+)" icon="arrow-trend-up">
  **Cause:** Very low baseline in previous period **Example:** - Previous
  period: KES 10,000 - Current period: KES 60,000 - Change: +500% This is
  mathematically correct but can look alarming. **Common when:** - Just started
  using Travada - Business had a very slow previous period - Comparing full
  month to partial month
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="All metrics showing 0%" icon="chart-line">
  **Cause:** No data in previous comparison period **Scenarios:** - First time
  using Travada - Selected date range with no historical data **Solution:**
  Record more trips to build historical data for comparisons
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Revenue higher than Income" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Problem:** This is impossible mathematically **Cause:** Data entry error
    or system issue **Action:** 1. Check Total Expense - is it showing negative?
    (shouldn't be) 2. Verify trip data in Expenditure page 3. Contact support if
    issue persists
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Financial Summary for Decision Making

### Monthly Review Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Overall Profitability">
    - Is Total Revenue positive?
    - Is it growing month-over-month?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analyze Income Trends">
    - Is Total Income growing?
    - If declining, is it seasonal or a business issue?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Expense Growth">
    - Are expenses growing proportionally to income?
    - If expenses growing faster, investigate why
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Calculate Profit Margin">
    ```
    Profit Margin = (Total Revenue ÷ Total Income) × 100
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    - Revenue: KES 50,000
    - Income: KES 200,000
    - Margin: 25%
    
    **Benchmarks:**
    - 20-30% = Healthy
    - 10-20% = Acceptable
    - < 10% = Concerning
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Take Action">
    Based on your analysis:
    - Increase rates if margins too low
    - Reduce costs if expenses too high
    - Focus on high-revenue routes
    - Investigate underperforming vehicles
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Document Unusual Periods" icon="note-sticky">
  If metrics are unusual due to: - Major repairs - Seasonal slowdown - New
  vehicle purchases - Rate negotiations Keep notes so you understand historical
  data later.
