<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Start each day by reviewing your dashboard. It takes less than 2 minutes and gives you complete situational awareness of your operations.
</Tip>

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard is organized into several sections, each providing specific insights:

### 1. Financial Summary Cards (Top Section)

Three key metrics displayed prominently:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Total Income" icon="coins">
    Revenue from all completed trips (Rate + Detention fees)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Total Expense" icon="receipt">
    All costs incurred across your fleet
  </Card>
  <Card title="Total Revenue" icon="chart-line">
    Your profit/loss (Income - Expenses)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<img src="/images/financial-summary-cards.png" alt="Financial Summary Cards" />

Each card shows:
- **Current Value** - The metric for your selected time period
- **Comparison** - Growth or decline vs. previous period
- **Trend Indicator** - ↑ (increase) or ↓ (decrease)

<Info>
  **Example:** If Total Income shows "KES 12,700.00" with "↑ 15%", this means income increased by 15% compared to the previous period.
</Info>

### 2. Financial Overview Chart

A bar chart comparing income vs expenses over time.

<img src="/images/financial-overview-chart.png" alt="Financial Overview Bar Chart" />

**What it shows:**
- Dark Green bars = Income
- Lime Green bars = Expenses
- X-axis = Time periods (days, weeks, or months depending on date filter)
- Y-axis = Amount(in your preferred currency)

**How to read it:**
- Taller dark green bars = Higher income periods
- Gap between dark and lime = Your profit margin
- Lime green bars taller than dark green = Loss period (expenses exceeded income)

<Tip>
  Look for patterns: Are certain days of the week more profitable? Are expenses rising faster than income?
</Tip>

### 3. Top Destinations by Revenue

A bar chart showing which destinations generate the most income.

<img src="/images/top-destinations-chart.png" alt="Top Destinations by Revenue" />

**Displays:**
- Top 5 highest revenue destinations
- Horizontal bars showing relative income amounts
- Actual revenue figures

**Interactive Features:**

<Note>
  **Click any destination bar** to see the 5 most recent trips to that destination, including:
  - Vehicle registration
  - Driver name
  - Trip date
  - Income earned
  - Expenses incurred
  - Net revenue
</Note>

<img src="/images/destination-trips-popup.png" alt="Recent Trips to Destination" />

**Use this to:**
- Focus on high-value routes
- Review trip details for specific destinations
- Negotiate better rates for top destinations
- Allocate vehicles strategically
- Identify which clients generate most business

<Info>
  **Example:** If "ARTCAFFE KISUMU" shows KES 98,400, this destination has generated the most revenue in your selected time period.
</Info>

### 4. Expense Breakdown (Pie Chart)

Visual breakdown of where your money is being spent.

<img src="/images/expense-breakdown-chart.png" alt="Expense Breakdown Pie Chart" />

**Categories shown:**
- **Fuel** - Usually the largest expense
- **Mileage Fee** - Driver allowances
- **Repair Cost** - Vehicle maintenance
- **Extra Cost** - Miscellaneous expenses
- **Parking** - Parking fees

**Each segment shows:**
- Category name
- Percentage of total expenses
- Actual amount in KES

<Warning>
  If fuel costs exceed 60-70% of total expenses, you may have opportunities to optimize fuel efficiency or negotiate better rates with fuel stations.
</Warning>

### 5. Trip Completion Trend

A line chart showing daily trip volume by vehicle type.

<img src="/images/trip-completion-trend.png" alt="Trip Completion Trend Line Chart" />

**What it tracks:**
- Number of trips completed per day
- Separate lines for each vehicle type (Truck, Canter, etc.)
- Trends over time

**Colors:**
- Green line = Trucks
- Dark green line = Canters
- (Additional colors for other vehicle types)

**Use this to:**
- Monitor operational activity levels
- Identify busy vs slow periods
- Plan vehicle maintenance during low-activity days
- Track seasonal patterns

### 6. Vehicle Performance

A table showing top-performing and underperforming vehicles.

<img src="/images/vehicle-performance-table.png" alt="Vehicle Performance Table" />

**Columns:**
- Vehicle registration number
- Number of trips completed
- Total income generated
- Total expenses incurred
- Net profit (or loss)

**Sections:**
- **Top Profitable Vehicles** - Your money-makers
- **Unprofitable Vehicles** - Vehicles losing money
- **Vehicles with No Trips** - Idle vehicles

**Filter Options:**

Use the dropdown in the top right to filter by:
- All Vehicles (default)
- Specific vehicle types (Truck, Canter, Dump Truck, etc.)

<img src="/images/vehicle-filter-dropdown.png" alt="Vehicle Filter Dropdown" />

**Interactive Features:**

<Note>
  **Click any vehicle** in the performance chart to see the 5 most recent trips for that vehicle, showing detailed trip information and profitability.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Action Item:** If a vehicle consistently shows in the "Unprofitable" section, investigate why. It might need maintenance, have route inefficiencies, or indicate driver issues.
</Tip>

## Date Filtering

Control what data you see using the date filter in the top right:

<img src="/images/date-filter-buttons.png" alt="Date Filter Options" />

**Quick filters:**
- **7D** - Last 7 days
- **1M** - Last month (default)
- **3M** - Last 3 months
- **6M** - Last 6 months
- **Custom** - Select specific date range

**How it works:**
- Click any button to instantly update all dashboard metrics
- All charts and cards refresh based on your selection
- Your selection persists across sessions

<Info>
  **Pro Tip:** Use 7D for daily operations monitoring, 1M for month-end reviews, and 3M/6M for strategic planning.
</Info>

## Understanding "N/A" Values

You might see "N/A" (Not Available) in some dashboard cards:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Total Expense shows N/A" icon="receipt">
    **Cause:** No expense data recorded for the selected period
    
    **Means:** 
    - No trips with expenses have been recorded
    - Or all recorded trips have zero expenses
    
    **Action:** Record trips with at least one expense field filled (Fuel, Parking, etc.)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Charts appear empty" icon="chart-simple">
    **Cause:** No data for the selected time period
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Extend your date range
    - Verify trips have been recorded
    - Check if trips are from a different time period
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Dashboard Customization

You can customize which charts appear on your dashboard using the **Edit** button.

<img src="/images/dashboard-edit-button.png" alt="Dashboard Edit Button" />

  <Step title="Select Charts to Display">
    A "Customise charts view" dialog will open showing available charts:
    
    **Top Destinations**
    - Top destinations by revenue over selected period
    - ✓ Checked = Visible
    - ☐ Unchecked = Hidden
    
    **Expense Analysis**
    - Expense patterns over selected period
    - Includes the Expense Breakdown pie chart

    Or click **Cancel** to keep current settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Use Case:** If you primarily focus on vehicle performance and financial overview, you can hide Top Destinations and Expense Analysis to reduce dashboard clutter and focus on what matters most to you.
</Tip>

### Default Charts (Always Visible)

These charts cannot be hidden and always appear on the dashboard:
- Financial Summary Cards (Income, Expense, Profit)
- Financial Overview bar chart
- Trip Completion Trend
- Vehicle Performance
- Most Recent Trips table

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why don't Income and Revenue match?" icon="coins">
    **Answer:** They measure different things!
    
    - **Total Income** = All revenue from trips (Rate + Detention)
    - **Total Revenue** = Profit after expenses (Income - Expenses)
    
    Revenue will always be less than Income (unless you have no expenses).
    
    **Example:**
    - Income: KES 100,000
    - Expenses: KES 60,000
    - Revenue (Profit): KES 40,000
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I export dashboard data?" icon="download">
    **Current Status:** Direct dashboard export is not available
    
    **Alternative:** Generate detailed reports from the Reports section, which can be shared and contain all the underlying data.
    
    See [Generating Reports](/features/reports/generating-rate-report) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often does the dashboard update?" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Answer:** Real-time
    
    The dashboard updates immediately when you:
    - Record a new trip
    - Edit existing data
    - Apply fuel discounts
    - Change date filters
    
    No need to refresh the page manually.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I see negative revenue?" icon="arrow-trend-down">
    **Meaning:** Your expenses exceeded your income for that period
    
    **Common causes:**
    - High repair costs
    - Low trip volume
    - Expensive fuel period
    - One-time major expense
    
    **Action:** 
    - Review expense breakdown to identify the main cost driver
    - Check vehicle performance for underperforming vehicles
    - Investigate if rates need adjustment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
