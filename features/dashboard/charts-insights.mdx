### How to Use This Data

**Interactive Drill-Down:**

Click on any destination bar to see detailed trip information:

<img src="/images/destination-drill-down.png" alt="Destination Trip Details" />

**What you'll see:**

- **Registration** - Which vehicle made the trips
- **Driver** - Who drove each trip
- **Date** - When trips occurred
- **Income** - Revenue per trip
- **Expenses** - Costs per trip
- **Revenue** - Profit per trip (shown in green)

The popup shows the **5 most recent trips** to that destination, allowing you to:

- Verify trip profitability
- See which vehicles service that route
- Check driver assignments
- Review recent trip patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Focus Resources">
    **Action:** Prioritize your best vehicles for top destinations **Example:**
    - If ARTCAFFE KISUMU is your #1 revenue source - Assign your most reliable
    truck to that route - Ensure minimal delays for those trips
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Negotiate Rates">
  **Action:** Use volume data in rate discussions **Example:** - "We've
  completed 20 trips to your location this month" - "Our consistent service
  justifies a volume discount/rate increase"
</Tab>

<Tab title="Identify Opportunities">
  **Action:** Spot underserved high-value routes **Example:** - If JAVA CBD is
  #2 but only has 3 trips - Each trip is very profitable - Consider marketing
  more aggressively to that client
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Risk Management">
    **Action:** Diversify if one destination dominates **Example:** - If one
    destination = 70% of revenue - You're vulnerable if that client leaves -
    Actively pursue other high-value routes
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
