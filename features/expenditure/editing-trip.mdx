## Overview

Currently, Travada's trip editing functionality is **limited**. This page explains what you can and cannot edit, current workarounds, and what's coming in future updates.

## Current Limitations

### What You CANNOT Edit

❌ **Vehicle Registration** - Cannot be changed after submission  
❌ **Driver Assignment** - Cannot be changed after submission  
❌ **Trip Date** - Cannot be changed after submission  
❌ **Financial Fields** - Cannot directly edit Rate, Detention, or expense amounts

<Warning>
  **Important:** Trip editing is a planned feature but not yet available in the current version of Travada. If you need to correct trip data, you'll need to use the workaround below.
</Warning>

## Current Workaround for Corrections

If you need to fix incorrect trip data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document the Correct Information">
    Write down all the correct trip details:
    - Correct vehicle
    - Correct driver
    - Correct destination
    - All correct amounts
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete the Incorrect Trip (Admin Only)">
    1. Find the trip in the Expenditure table
    2. Click the **⋮** (three dots) menu
    3. Select **Delete**
    4. Confirm deletion
    
    <Warning>
      Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Re-record with Correct Information">
    1. Click **+ New Trip**
    2. Enter all details correctly
    3. Verify everything before submitting
    4. Click **Submit**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify in Dashboard">
    Check that your Dashboard and reports now show correct data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting Trips

### Who Can Delete

Only **Admin** users can delete trips. Staff users will not see the delete option.

### How to Delete a Trip

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Trip">
    Find the trip in the Expenditure table
    
    Use filters if needed to narrow down the list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Actions Menu">
    Click the **⋮** (three dots) icon on the right side of the trip row
    
    <img src="/images/trip-actions-menu.png" alt="Trip Actions Menu" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Delete">
    Click **Delete** from the dropdown menu
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    A confirmation dialog will appear
    
    **Review carefully** - this cannot be undone!
    
    Click **Confirm** to proceed or **Cancel** to abort
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Deletion">
    - Trip disappears from table
    - Dashboard updates automatically
    - Income and expense totals recalculate
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens When You Delete

When you delete a trip, Travada automatically:
- ✅ Removes the trip from the Expenditure table
- ✅ Recalculates Total Income (decreases)
- ✅ Recalculates Total Expense (decreases)
- ✅ Recalculates Total Revenue
- ✅ Updates all charts and visualizations
- ✅ Removes from Income and Expense pages
- ✅ Excludes from future reports

<Info>
  **Historical Data:** If the deleted trip was already included in a generated report, the report remains unchanged. Reports are static once created.
</Info>

## When to Delete vs. Keep

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Delete When">
    ✅ **Completely duplicate entry**
    - Same trip recorded twice
    - Clear data entry error
    
    ✅ **Wrong vehicle/driver assigned**
    - No way to edit, must delete and re-record
    
    ✅ **Significant amount errors**
    - Off by 10x or more
    - Wrong currency or decimal place
    
    ✅ **Test entries**
    - Practice trips during system setup
    - Dummy data from training
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Keep When">
    ✅ **Minor amount discrepancies**
    - Small rounding differences
    - Can be explained/documented
    
    ✅ **Historical corrections**
    - Trip happened as recorded
    - Later discovered better information
    - Add a note rather than deleting
    
    ✅ **Part of audit trail**
    - Financial period already closed
    - Reports already generated
    - Accounting already processed
    
    ✅ **Questionable but possible**
    - Unusual but might be legitimate
    - Verify with driver/client first
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Impact on Reports

<Warning>
  **Important:** If you delete a trip after generating reports that included it, those reports remain unchanged. Generated reports are static snapshots.
</Warning>

**What this means:**
- Reports show data as it was at generation time
- Deleting trips doesn't update existing reports
- You may need to regenerate reports after corrections

**Best practice:**
- Make corrections before month-end
- Regenerate reports after significant changes
- Keep notes of corrections made
