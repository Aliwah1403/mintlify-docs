## Overview

The Expenditure page is where you record and manage all trip data in Travada. Each trip entry captures the vehicle used, driver assigned, destination, income earned, and expenses incurred. This is the foundation of your entire financial tracking system.

## What is Expenditure?

In Travada, "Expenditure" refers to the complete trip recording system where you:
- ✅ Record every trip your vehicles make
- ✅ Capture income (Rate and Detention fees)
- ✅ Log expenses (Fuel, Parking, Repairs, etc.)
- ✅ Track which vehicle and driver handled each trip
- ✅ Document destinations and dates

<Info>
  Every entry in Expenditure automatically updates your Dashboard, Income pages, Expense pages, and Reports. It's the single source of truth for all your financial data.
</Info>

## Page Layout

The Expenditure page consists of two main sections:

### 1. Action Bar (Top)

Located at the top of the page:

- **Data Filter** - Filter trips by multiple criteria
- **Date Range** - Select time period to view
- **Export** - Download trip data
- **View Options** - Customize table display

### 2. Trip Data Table (Main)

## Understanding the Data Flow

When you record a trip in Expenditure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trip Recorded">
    You enter all trip details in the New Trip form
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Saved">
    Travada stores the complete trip record
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Dashboard Updates">
    Financial summary cards refresh automatically:
    - Total Income increases by Rate + Detention
    - Total Expense increases by all costs
    - Total Revenue recalculates (Income - Expenses)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Charts Update">
    All visualizations reflect the new data:
    - Financial Overview shows new bars
    - Trip Completion Trend adds a data point
    - Expense Breakdown recalculates percentages
    - Vehicle Performance updates for that vehicle
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pages Populate">
    Trip appears in relevant sections:
    - Income → Rate tab (if rate fee exists)
    - Income → Detention tab (if detention fee exists)
    - Expenses → All tab
    - Expenses → Fuel tab (if fuel cost exists)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reports Ready">
    Data becomes available for report generation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  This automatic data flow is why accurate trip recording is so important - everything else in Travada depends on it!

## Understanding Trip Status

Trips in Travada are always "Completed" - meaning they've already happened and you're recording historical data. Unlike some systems, Travada doesn't track:
- ❌ Scheduled/future trips
- ❌ In-progress trips
- ❌ Trip status changes

**Why?** Travada is designed for **financial tracking**, not dispatch management. You record trips after they're completed to track income and expenses.

<Note>
  If you need to track scheduled or in-progress trips, consider using a separate dispatch system and then recording completed trips in Travada for financial tracking.
</Note>

## Data Accuracy Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify Before Submit" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Common mistakes to catch:**
    - Wrong vehicle selected
    - Wrong driver assigned
    - Decimal point errors in amounts
    - Missing expense categories
    
    Take 10 seconds to review before clicking Submit.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Trip Sheets" icon="file-lines">
    **Paper trail:**
    - Give drivers trip sheets to fill out
    - Include spaces for all expense categories
    - Have drivers submit at end of day
    - Enter from completed trip sheets
    
    This reduces memory errors and missing data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Standardize Destinations" icon="location-dot">
    **Create a master list:**
    - JAVA CBD (not "java", "Java cbd", "JAVA-CBD")
    - ARTCAFFE KISUMU (not "Artcaffe", "Art Caffe")
    - GM (not "General Motors", "g.m.")
    
    Consistency enables better filtering and reporting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep Receipts" icon="receipt">
    **Documentation:**
    - Fuel receipts
    - Parking tickets
    - Repair invoices
    - Any payment proofs
    
    File these with trip sheets for audit trail and verification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
