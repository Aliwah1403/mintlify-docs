## Setup & Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't add a vehicle - form won't submit" icon="truck">
    **Possible Causes:**
    - Required fields are empty
    - Vehicle registration format is incorrect
    - Vehicle type or ownership not selected
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Ensure all three fields are filled:
       - Vehicle Registration (max 8 characters)
       - Vehicle Type (select from dropdown)
       - Vehicle Ownership (select Owned or Hired)
    
    2. Check that Vehicle Registration doesn't contain special characters
    
    3. Try clicking the dropdown menus even if they appear filled - sometimes the value needs to be re-selected
    
    <Tip>
      Vehicle registration should be in format like "KBE 127H" or "KDA 631Q" - standard Kenyan format works best
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't add a driver - missing permissions" icon="user-slash">
    **Cause:** You need Admin permissions to add drivers
    
    **Solution:**
    - Check if you have Admin access (look for the Admin badge in your profile)
    - If you're Staff, contact your administrator to add the driver
    - Or request Admin permissions if your role requires it
    
    <Note>
      See [User Roles & Permissions](/getting-started/user-roles) for details on role capabilities
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Don't see my newly added vehicle in trip form" icon="eye-slash">
    **Cause:** Page hasn't refreshed after adding vehicle
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Refresh your browser page (F5 or Cmd+R)
    2. Or navigate away and back to Expenditure
    3. The vehicle should now appear in the dropdown
    
    If still not showing:
    - Verify the vehicle was actually saved (check the Vehicles page)
    - Ensure the vehicle is not disabled
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trip Recording Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trip form won't advance to second page" icon="hand">
    **Cause:** Required fields on page 1 are not filled
    
    **Solution:**
    Ensure these fields are completed:
    - ✅ Trip Date selected
    - ✅ Vehicle Registration selected
    - ✅ Driver selected
    - ✅ Destination entered (text field)
    
    <Warning>
      The Destination field must have at least one character. Even if you don't have a specific destination, enter "TBD" or a placeholder.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Accidentally entered wrong vehicle for a trip" icon="rotate-left">
    **Problem:** Trip recorded with incorrect vehicle assignment
    
    **Current Limitation:** You cannot edit the vehicle or driver after trip submission
    
    **Workaround:**
    1. Note all the trip details (date, destination, costs)
    2. Delete the incorrect trip (Admin only)
    3. Re-record the trip with the correct vehicle
    
    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Before clicking Submit, double-check the vehicle registration matches the trip you're recording
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="All my expense fields show KES 0 - can I leave them empty?" icon="zero">
    **Answer:** Yes! You don't need to fill in every expense field.
    
    **How It Works:**
    - Only fill in the expenses that actually occurred for that trip
    - Empty fields automatically default to KES 0
    - This ensures your expense reports are accurate
    
    **Example:**
    - If a trip had no parking fees, leave Parking Cost empty
    - If no repairs were needed, leave Repair Cost empty
    
    The system will calculate totals based only on fields you filled in.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Entered wrong amount for fuel - how do I fix it?" icon="pen-to-square">
    **Problem:** Need to edit trip costs after submission
    
    **Current Limitation:** Trip editing is not yet available in the current version
    
    **Workaround (Admin only):**
    1. Note all the trip details
    2. Delete the trip
    3. Re-record with correct amounts
    
    **Future Feature:** Trip editing is coming in a future Travada update
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Income & Expense Tracking

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My dashboard shows 'N/A' for Total Expense" icon="chart-mixed">
    **Cause:** No expense data has been recorded yet
    
    **Solution:**
    This is normal if you:
    - Just started using Travada
    - Haven't recorded any trips with expenses
    - Recorded trips with only Rate fees but no expense fields filled
    
    **To Fix:**
    1. Record trips with at least one expense field filled (Fuel, Parking, etc.)
    2. Refresh the dashboard
    3. Total Expense should now display a value
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Income and revenue show the same amount - is this correct?" icon="equals">
    **Answer:** It depends on your data!
    
    **Explanation:**
    - **Total Income** = Rate fees + Detention fees
    - **Total Revenue** = Total Income - Total Expenses
    
    If you have:
    - Income recorded but no expenses → Revenue = Income ✅
    - Both income and expenses → Revenue should be less than Income ✅
    
    **If they match when you have expenses:**
    - Check that your trip records include expense fields
    - Verify expenses are showing on the Expenses page
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't see yesterday's trip on the dashboard" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Cause:** Date filter is set to a different time period
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Look for the date range selector (top right on most pages)
    2. Current options: 7D (7 days), 1M (1 month), 3M, 6M, or custom date range
    3. Ensure your date range includes yesterday
    4. If using custom range, verify start and end dates are correct

</AccordionGroup>

## Fuel Discount Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't apply fuel discount - button is grayed out" icon="gas-pump">
    **Cause:** Either you lack permissions or no trips are selected
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check permissions:** Only Admins can apply fuel discounts
    2. **For individual discount:** Ensure you clicked the ⋮ menu on a row with fuel cost > 0
    3. **For bulk discount:** 
       - Select trips using checkboxes
       - Verify selected trips have fuel costs (not KES 0)
       - Click "Add discount" in the bottom toolbar
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fuel discount calculation shows unexpected number" icon="calculator">
    **Common Causes:**
    - Incorrect Standard Fuel Price entered
    - Discounted Price higher than Standard Price (should be lower!)
    - Original Fuel Cost in trip was wrong
    
    **How to Fix:**
    1. Verify current market fuel price for that date
    2. Check that Discounted Price < Standard Price
    3. Remove the discount and reapply with correct values
    
    **Example of Correct Values:**
    - Standard Price: KES 150/L
    - Discounted Price: KES 145/L (must be lower!)
    - If Fuel Cost is KES 12,000 → Discount should be positive
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Applied discount to wrong trips - how do I undo?" icon="undo">
    **Solution:** Remove the discount, then reapply to correct trips
    
    **For Individual:**
    1. Click ⋮ on the incorrect trip
    2. Select "Remove Discount"
    3. Confirm removal
    
    **For Bulk:**
    1. Select all trips with incorrect discounts (checkboxes)
    2. Click "Remove discount" in toolbar
    3. Click X to confirm
    4. Then select correct trips and reapply
    
    <Note>
      Removing discounts is permanent - you'll need to re-enter the values when reapplying
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Report Generation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't generate report - missing permissions" icon="lock">
    **Cause:** Only Admins can generate reports
    
    **Solution:**
    - Contact your administrator to generate the report for you
    - Or request Admin permissions if your role requires report generation
    - Provide your admin with the specific date range and client details needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Generated report shows wrong trips or amounts" icon="file-excel">
    **Cause:** Incorrect filters applied before generation
    
    **Problem:** You can't edit a report once generated
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Delete the incorrect report (⋮ → Delete report)
    2. Go back to Income → Rate tab
    3. Clear all filters
    4. Carefully set correct filters:
       - Date range
       - Vehicle (if needed)
       - Destination (if needed)
    5. Verify the "Total Rate Fee" is correct before clicking Generate Report
    6. Generate a new report
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Report link says 'Expired' when I share it" icon="link-slash">
    **Cause:** Report expiry date has passed
    
    **Solution:**
    Reports expire after the period you set (default 30 days).
    
    **To Fix:**
    1. Generate a new report
    2. Set a longer expiry period this time (e.g., 90 days)
    3. Share the new link
    
    **Best Practice:**
    - For client reports: 60-90 day expiry
    - For internal monthly reports: 30-45 days
    - For annual summaries: 365 days
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Need both rate and detention in one report" icon="file-invoice">
    **Current Limitation:** Rate and Detention are separate report types
    
    **Workaround:**
    1. Generate a Rate Report for rate fees
    2. Check if Detention Reports are available (feature may be in development)
    3. Manually combine totals if needed for invoicing
    
    **Future Feature:** Combined income reports coming in future version
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Vehicle & Driver Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Need to temporarily stop using a vehicle - what should I do?" icon="truck">
    **Solution:** Disable the vehicle instead of deleting it
    
    **Why Disable Instead of Delete:**

    **How to Disable:**
    1. Go to Vehicles → Disabled Vehicles

    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Driver contract ended - should I delete them?" icon="user-xmark">
    **Best Practice:** Disable instead of delete
    
    **Why:**

    **How to Disable:**

    4. Confirm
    
    <Warning>
      **Never delete** drivers who have historical trips in the system - this can cause data integrity issues
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disabled multiple vehicles by mistake - how to undo?" icon="rotate-left">
    **Solution:** Re-enable them from Disabled Vehicles page

    4. Try selecting a wider date range first, then narrow down
    
    <Tip>

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
