## Overview

Drivers must be added to Travada before they can be assigned to trips. Each driver profile contains their basic contact information and remains in the system even after they're assigned to multiple trips, making it easy to track individual driver performance.

## Prerequisites

Before adding drivers, ensure you have:

- Driver names (full names as they appear on licenses)
- Driver phone numbers

## Driver Information Required

| Field                     | Description     | Example                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Driver's Name**         | Full legal name | John Kamau, Jane Wanjiru |
| **Driver's Phone Number** | Contact number  | 0765843567, 0708492343   |

<Info>
  Only two fields are required to add a driver. Keep it simple and quick!

    ![Driver Name Field](/Screenshot2026-01-30at9.27.34am-1.png)

    **Best Practices:**

    - Use the driver's full legal name
    - Be consistent with naming format across all drivers

    <Info>
      No need to worry about capitalization. Travada takes care of this, making the process simple and seamless
    </Info>
    <Tip>
      If you have multiple drivers with the same first name, include their full name or add a nickname in parentheses: "John Kamau (Senior)" or "John Omondi"
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Driver's Phone Number">
    In the **Driver's Phone Number** field, enter their contact number

    ![Driver Phone Field](/Screenshot2026-01-30at9.27.34am-2.png)

    **Format:**

    - Include country code or use local format
    - Common formats: 0712345678 or +254712345678
    - No spaces or special characters needed (system accepts both)

    <Info>
      Phone numbers are used for contact reference. They don't need to be verified or active.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Driver">
    Click the **Add driver** button at the bottom of the form

    ![Save Driver Button](/Screenshot2026-01-30at9.27.34am-3.png)

    If successful, you'll see:

    - A success notification
    - The driver appears in the drivers list
    - The form closes automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Adding a Driver

Once added, the driver will:

- ✅ Appear in the drivers list on the Drivers page
- ✅ Be available in the driver dropdown when recording trips
- ✅ Be included in driver performance analytics (future feature)
- ✅ Have a complete trip history accessible in reports

## Adding Multiple Drivers

To add multiple drivers efficiently:

### Quick Batch Entry Method

1. **Prepare your list** - Have all driver names and phone numbers ready
2. **Keep form open** - After adding each driver, the form resets
3. **Enter quickly** - Fill name → phone → add → repeat
4. **Verify** - Check the drivers list periodically to ensure all are added

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** If adding 10+ drivers, prepare a spreadsheet with two columns (Name, Phone) and keep it open while entering. This speeds up the process significantly.
</Tip>

### Sample Spreadsheet Template

| Driver Name  | Phone Number |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| John Kamau   | 0765843567   |
| Jane Wanjiru | 0708492343   |
| Peter Omondi | 0722334455   |

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>

    - Check for any error messages in red below the fields
    - Verify phone number doesn't contain invalid characters
    - Refresh page and try again if form seems stuck
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Driver not showing in trip form dropdown" icon="eye-slash">
    **Cause:** Page hasn't refreshed after adding driver

    **Solution:**

    1. Refresh your browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
    2. Or navigate to Expenditure and back
    3. Driver should now appear in dropdown

    If still not showing:

    - Verify driver was actually saved (check Drivers page)
    - Ensure driver is not disabled
    - Check if you're on the correct workspace/account
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accidentally entered wrong phone number" icon="phone-slash">
    **Solution:** You can edit the driver information after creation

    1. Go to Drivers page
    2. Click ⋮ on the driver's row
    3. Select Edit
    4. Update phone number
    5. Save

    See [Editing Drivers](/features/drivers/editing-driver) for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Same driver name already exists" icon="copy">
    **Issue:** Multiple drivers may have the same name

    **Solution:**

    - Travada allows duplicate names (common in real operations)
    - Differentiate by adding nickname or ID: "John Kamau (Senior)" or "John K. 001"
    - Use phone numbers to identify the correct driver when assigning trips
    - Consider including vehicle assignments in driver names if they're dedicated: "John (KBE 127H)"

## When a Driver Leaves

If a driver is no longer working for you:

<Warning>
  **Important:** Do NOT delete drivers who have historical trips in the system. This can cause data integrity issues.
</Warning>

Instead, **disable** the driver:

1. Go to **Drivers** → **Inactive Drivers**
2. Click **\+ Disable Driver**
3. Select the driver(s) to disable
4. Confirm

Disabled drivers:

- ✅ Won't appear in trip recording dropdowns
- ✅ Maintain all historical trip data
- ✅ Can be re-enabled if they return to work

See [Disabling Drivers](/features/drivers/disabling-drivers) for full instructions.
