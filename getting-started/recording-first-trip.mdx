## Overview

Recording trips is the core activity in Travada. Each trip entry captures the income earned and expenses incurred, allowing the system to calculate profitability automatically. This guide walks you through recording your very first trip.

## Before You Start

Ensure you have:
- At least one vehicle added to the system ([Add Vehicles](/getting-started/adding-vehicles))
- At least one driver added to the system ([Add Drivers](/getting-started/adding-drivers))
- Trip details ready (date, destination, costs)

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Have all your trip documents ready before you start - receipts, fuel slips, rate agreements, etc. This makes data entry faster and more accurate.
</Tip>

## Understanding Trip Entry

The trip entry form has **three pages**:

**Page 1:** Basic trip information
- Trip date
- Vehicle registration
- Driver name
- Destination

**Page 2:** Financial details
- Income (Rate fee, Detention fee)
- Expenses (Fuel, Clerk fee, Mileage, Parking)

**Page 3:** More Financial details
- Repair Expenses (cost and description)
- Extra Expenses (cost and description)

<Info>
  You must complete Page 1 before you can access Pages 2 & 3. All fields are required on every page. If there is no expense or income to be filled, enter "0" as the value, and "None" as the description where required.

    **If not applicable:** Leave blank or enter 0

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Forgetting to click Next on Page 1" icon="arrow-right">
    **Symptom:** Can't see expense fields
    
    **Solution:** Make sure all Page 1 fields are filled, then click the Next button to access Page 2
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Selecting wrong vehicle" icon="truck-monster">
    **Problem:** Clicked wrong vehicle from dropdown
    
    **Prevention:** Double-check the registration number before clicking Next
    
    **Fix:** You'll need to go back to Step 1 to change the vehicle, or edit the trip after submitting.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Entering fuel discount in Fuel Cost" icon="gas-pump">
    **Mistake:** Subtracting discount from fuel cost before entering
    
    **Correct Way:**
    - Enter the full amount paid in Fuel Cost
    - Apply discount separately using the fuel discount feature later
    
    This ensures you track both the actual cost and the savings accurately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mixing up Rate and Detention" icon="coins">
    **Confusion:** Not sure which fee goes where
    
    **Clarification:**
    - **Rate** = The base charge for the trip/transport service
    - **Detention** = Extra fee for delays (container trucks only)
    
    Most trips only have Rate. Detention is less common.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Trying to fill every expense field" icon="square-check">
    **Issue:** Thinking all fields are required
    
    **Reality:** Only fill in expenses that actually occurred
    
    **Example:** If no parking fees were paid, leave Parking Cost blank or enter 0
  </Accordion>
