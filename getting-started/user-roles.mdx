## Admin-Only Features

Throughout this documentation, features that are **Admin-only** will be clearly marked with this badge:

<Note>
  🔒 **Admin Only** - This action requires Administrator permissions
</Note>

When you see this badge, remember that Staff users will not have access to perform that action.

## How to Identify Your Role

You can identify your current role by:

1. Looking at your user profile in the top right corner
2. Attempting to access restricted features (Admin-only features will be hidden or disabled for Staff users)
3. Checking with your system administrator

## Requesting Role Changes

If you need different permissions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Your Admin">
    Reach out to your organization's Travada administrator
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explain Your Needs">
    Describe which features you need access to and why
  </Step>
  <Step title="Admin Updates Role">
    Your administrator can change your role from the Organization Settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Follow the principle of least privilege - users should only have the minimum permissions needed to perform their job functions.
</Tip>
