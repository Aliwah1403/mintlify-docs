## Overview

Vehicles are the foundation of your Travada system. Before you can record trips, you need to add your vehicles to the platform. Each vehicle is identified by its registration number and classified by type and ownership.

## Prerequisites

Before adding vehicles, ensure you have:
- List of vehicle registration numbers (license plates)
- Information about vehicle types
- Ownership status (owned vs hired) for each vehicle

## Vehicle Information Required

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Vehicle Registration** | License plate number (max 8 characters) | KBE 127H, KDA 631Q |
| **Vehicle Type** | Category of vehicle from dropdown | Dump Truck, Reefer Truck, Canter |
| **Vehicle Ownership** | Whether owned or hired | Owned or Hired |
